        <div class="About">
            <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the
                order in which they were born.
                These <strong>"day names"</strong> have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the
                person.
                Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order,
                twin status, or an <em>ancestor's</em> middle name.</p>

            <p>Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English or Christian
                name.
                Notable figures with day names include <span>Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah and former United
                    Nations
                    Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Get more about Akhan names.<a
